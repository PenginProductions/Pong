This Python project uses the 'Livewires' library of code as well as custom class objects to
recreate the game of Pong.

Tips:

To move the paddle, use either 'w' and 's' keys or the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.

The player only has one life in this version; missing the ball is a 'Game Over'.

Have fun!
